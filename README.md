# Speech-to-Speech Translator by Carlos Guerrero Alvarez and Aamish Ahmad Beg
## Introduction
This project is a speech-to-speech translator developed as part of the COSC 094 course at Dartmouth College. The goal of this project is to create a tool that can convert spoken language from one language to another in real-time, providing an efficient means of communication across language barriers.

In the specfic implementation we have planned to use, we are using Spanish voice input, converting it to English, and then generating English voice output.

The project will comprise of three modules, each of which encapsulating a model. The implmentation tooling will be PyTorch-based.

## Features
* Real-time speech recognition: The program can capture and convert spoken language into text.
* Translation: The translation part of the program will then be able to convert this text to another language.
* Speech generation: the program can convert the translated text to spoken language.
